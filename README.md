HMMR

User-freindly and flexible model anf algorithm for time series segmentation with a Regression
model with a Hidden Markov Model Regression (HMMR).


Hidden Markov Model Regression (HMMR) for segmentation of time series
with regime changes. The model assumes that the time series is
governed by a sequence of hidden discrete regimes/states, where each
regime/state has Gaussian regressors as observations.
The model parameters are estimated by MLE via the EM algorithm
